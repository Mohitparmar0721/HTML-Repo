# User Information Form

This project contains a simple **User Information Form** built with HTML. The form allows users to input their personal details in a structured way.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Fields**: The form includes input fields for:

  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone Number
  - Date of Birth
  - Gender (dropdown selection)
  - Comments (text area)

- **Validation**:

  - The `required` attribute ensures that Name, Email, and Phone Number fields must be filled before submission.
  - The Email field validates the format automatically.

- **Buttons**:
  - **Submit**: Sends the form data to a server or another page (currently `submit_page.html`).
  - **Reset**: Clears all input fields.
