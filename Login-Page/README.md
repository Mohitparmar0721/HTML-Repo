# HTML Login Page

This is a basic login page built using only HTML. The form collects a username and password from the user and submits it to the server using the `POST` method.

## Features

- **User Input Fields**:
  - A text input field for the username.
  - A password input field for the password.
- **Form Submission**:
  - Sends data securely using the `POST` method to the action URL (`/login.java`).
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Includes meta tags for proper scaling on mobile devices.

## File Structure

- **HTML File**:
  - Contains the structure of the login page.

## How to Use

1. Save the code as an `.html` file (e.g., `login.html`).
2. Open the file in any web browser.
3. Enter your username and password, then click the "Login" button.
